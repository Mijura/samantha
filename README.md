# Samantha (Inspired by *Her*)

Inspired by the movie *Her*, this project explores what it would feel like to interact with your email the way Joaquin Phoenix does with Samantha â€” but using text instead of voice.

This is a 3-hour build for the **AI Vibe Coding Hackathon** at **Startit Serbia**.

## âœ¨ Vision  
Imagine managing your Gmail inbox with a deeply intelligent assistant. Not just searching or sorting, but **summarizing**, **analyzing**, and **sending emails** â€” all through natural language. No clicks. No clutter. Just vibes.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does  
- Connect your Gmail account  
- Summarize recent conversations  
- Analyze sentiment or intent in threads  
- Draft and send replies based on your guidance  
- All through a simple text interface

## ðŸ”— What's Next  
We're starting with text, but the long-term vision is to bring the same emotional depth and fluid interaction as seen in *Her*. Samantha, reimagined for real life.
